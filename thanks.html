<p> Here are some facts about clowns:</p>
<p> - If you can smell face paint and burnt herbs, that means there is probably a clown nearby. </p>
<p> - Clowns are most active around 2-4am on weekdays.</p>
<p> - Most clowns are attracted to bright colours and they like shiny objects </p>
<p> - You can catch a clown my putting some cooked lobster under a trap. They can smell cooked lobster from about 200 metres away.</p>
<p> - Clowns don't reproduce like other mammals, they amputate a finger and water it every day until it grows into a complete clown.</p>
<p> - They can completly grow back fingers and toes within three weeks (depending on how much they eat)</p>
<p> - Clowns can have Coulrophobia.</p>
<p> - The average lifespan of a clown is 170-200</p>
<p> - Clowns don't have genders</p>
