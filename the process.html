  <p>- Clown juice contains clown extract and 1.6% clown brain liquids. That's all it takes.</p>
<p> - If the child doesn't want to have a needle inside their arm, dont worry. We have the strength of the average human, which is no match to a small child. If the child is too strong, we have tranqueliser guns as a plan B.</p>
	<p> - It only takes about six hours for the child to fully become clownified.</p>
	<p> - Within the 6 hours the child may start singing in italin gibberish, because it's IQ is either dropping or rising by the second. </p>
	<p> - If the child has a reaction to the clown juice then we have an alternative juice which is called Funny Juice. It's like clown juice but it doesn't have any asbestos in it. The asbestos is replaced with helium. It's also blue in colour. </p>
